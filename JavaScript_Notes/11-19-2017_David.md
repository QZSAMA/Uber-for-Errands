## Goals

Today's goal is to complete the first version of the models with all associations.



## Blockers

- Users
  - what is the i for in `is: /^[a-z]+$/i, `the regular expression validation [here](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/models-definition.html#validations)
  - when validating phone numbers, how can I make it so that all phone numbers are stored in one format in the database? Prefereably 1-845-662-9179
  - how can I update the avg. rating every time the user gets a new review?
  - how can I validate adresses via google maps api?
- Ratings
  - `Ratings` has three seaparate foreign ids to each rating, the `subject` (user being rated—a userId), the `author` (user writing the review—another userId), and the `post` (postId). How can I associate this one table with the same `Users` table twice, for two different columns `author` and `subject`? Associating `post` should be simple since its just a one-to-one relationship. One post gets one rating.
- Skills
  - what does the return skills line do before the final bracket of module.exports?

## Long term concerns:

- to react or to handlebar, that is the question.
- how to implement an autocomplete component with react for a tagging system for each skill (stack exchange is a great example of such a tagging system)
- what about image storage?
