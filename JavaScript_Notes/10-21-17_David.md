### Messing Around with Brew Package Manager for Mac
Brew tap adds additional functionality to Brew

#### Problem: Postgresql runs using `brew services start postgresql` but `createuser` utility from Postgresql returns an error.
- the problem was the $PATH variable
- $PATH is an environmental variable that specifies directories where executable files are located. Bash searches the directories listed in /etc/paths (on Mac) for all programs. Bash does this in order, so if it searches and finds Python 2.6 before Python 2.7 because the Python 2.6 directory is higher on the list in the /etc/paths file, then it will be used by bash every time you call python. 
- I tried editing /etc/paths directly, but that didn't work; what did work was adding the following line to my `.bash_profile` file : `PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH`. This line pre-appends the directory where all the Brew applications are installed as the top line in /etc/paths.
- Also I learned that /etc/paths is generally not good to edit since it changes variables globally--for all users, not just me. The .bash_profile strategy is better.
- `createuser` works perfectly now

#### The Takeaway:
- if you check the installation directory of the program with `which [program]` and you find that the directory doesn't match Brew's install location `/usr/local/bin/[program]` then there's a path problem.

### Problem: Postgresql was not allowing me to create a user account:
- The error message read: `could not connect to server: No such file or directory. Is the server running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?`
- Solved the problem by brew uninstalling and then reinstalling and then running `brew cleanup postgresql`.

### Problem: Polls App Not Starting Up
- forgot to run `npm install` before `npm start` to install all js dependencies
- the username for postgresql edgardo used is different from the one I set up my installation with. Found the password file in `/config/config.json`
